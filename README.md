# Christian Movie, Book Recommendation System

## Problem/Case Statement:

There are many Christian movies and books available, but it can be difficult to find ones that are both entertaining and inspiring. This project aims to develop a recommendation system that can suggest Christian movies and books that are tailored to the user's individual preferences.

### Objectives:
- Collect data with predominantly Christian content
- Clean and preprocess the data
- Use cosine similarity to measure the similarity between different verses, movies and books.
- Develop a user interface that allows users to easily browse and search for recommendations.
- Deploy the recommendation system to a web server so that it can be accessed by users from anywhere in the world.
### Sourcing and Sources:

- Christian book data scraped from [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api).
- The [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/) used to collect data on user preferences.
### Steps in the Solution So Far:

- A dataset of Christian movies and books has been collected from publicly available sources.
- The dataset has been cleaned and pre-processed.
- A cosine similarity algorithm has been implemented to measure the similarity between different movies and books.
- A user interface has been developed that allows users to easily browse and search for recommendations.
### Future Plans:

The following are some of the future plans for the project:

- Deploy the recommendation system to a web server so that it can be accessed by users from anywhere in the world.
- Develop a mobile app for the recommendation system.
- Add support for additional languages.
- Collect more user data to improve the accuracy of the recommendations.
### Scaling:

The current version of the project is hosted on Kaggle, but it is only accessible to users with a Kaggle account. In the future, the project will be deployed to a web server so that it can be accessed by users from anywhere in the world. The web server will be hosted on a cloud platform such as Google Cloud Platform or Amazon Web Services (AWS). This will ensure that the website is highly available and scalable.

### Conclusion:

This project has the potential to make Christian movies and books more accessible to people all over the world. The recommendation system will help users to find movies and books that they are likely to enjoy. The project will also help to promote Christian values and encourage people to live a Christian life.
